Work and tests in progress to create a mini tool of chaos engineering against eks nodes.

Objective: Randomly terminate a worker node, recycle pods, make nonsense requests to services at k8s

Notes:Using len to count instances and random to print ids,
now working to stop instance with the random selected Id
